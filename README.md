# Hair Salon

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  This program is a demonstration of one-to-many MySql database relationships created using C# and CSHTML in a .NET Core and MVC environment, and fully integrated with a MySQL schema. It's purpose is to create a user-friendly tracking system for a hair salon owner to organize the stylists they employ and keep track of the list of clients and which clients are associated with each stylists. Each stylist may be associated with many clients, but each client is associated with only one stylist, hence the one-to-many database relationship. While simple and not yet fully built out with all the possibly useful functionality, the essential features of C# and .NET development using databases are present and easily usable.
